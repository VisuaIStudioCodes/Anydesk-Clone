# Anydesk-Clone

A lightweight clone of the AnyDesk-style remote desktop experience. This repository is a starter
project intended for learning, prototyping, and extending with your own features.

## Overview

Anydesk-Clone aims to provide the foundations for:

- Session initiation between a host and a client
- Secure connection negotiation (placeholder for future TLS/DTLS work)
- Input forwarding (keyboard/mouse) and basic screen streaming

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (to be added as the project evolves).
3. Run the application (startup scripts will be added once the runtime stack is defined).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Define runtime stack and dependencies
- [ ] Add build/run scripts
- [ ] Implement signaling and session lifecycle
- [ ] Add authentication and encryption
- [ ] Build a minimal UI for host/client roles

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please describe the problem and proposed solution clearly.

## License

This project does not yet define a license. Add one if you plan to distribute the code.
