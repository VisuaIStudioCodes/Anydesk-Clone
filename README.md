# Anydesk-Clone

A lightweight proof-of-concept Anydesk-style remote desktop clone. This repository currently contains a static HTML prototype and can be extended with client/server logic, UI, and signaling.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the UI prototype.
3. Add the desired client/server implementation.
4. Update this README with build/run instructions once the runtime is in place.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement signaling server
- [ ] Add desktop capture + streaming client
- [ ] Build a basic UI for connections

## License

MIT (or update with the appropriate license for your use case).
